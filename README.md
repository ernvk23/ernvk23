# Hi, I'm Edgar üëã

I'm an Automation Engineer who finds joy in the space where hardware meets software. My journey has taken me from firmware and digital systems to backend engineering, and honestly? I love every bit of it.

## About Me

* I build software with a systems-level understanding, from the low-level details up to the application.
* My main tools are **Python** and **Go**, but I have a soft spot for the raw power of **C** and **Assembly**.
* I'm a passionate advocate for **Open-Source** (proud Fedora user and Neovim enthusiast) and fascinated by **IoT**.
* I'm always writing scripts to automate tasks and make my life a little easier.
* When I unplug, I'm often listening to podcasts on neuroscience and psychology, improving my social dancing, or simply appreciating the little things in life.

## Currently

* Focusing on backend systems and cloud-native development.
* Diving deeper into **DevOps** practices and the world of **ML**.
* Trying to shake the rust off my chess game and keep my strategic thinking sharp. ‚ôüÔ∏è
